      <title>Rust: Results, Options and Combinators</title>
      <link>https://benp44.github.io/blog/posts/useful-rust-combinators/</link>

      <description>As you start to write Rust code, you find yourself regularly using the match syntax. This comes up due to Rust&amp;rsquo;s error handling pattern, specifically the Result and Option types. Personally, I found that writing matches got old quite quickly. Rust is a concise language in general, so the match-blocks feels verbose, and I start to feel uncomfortable with the indented blocks of code that often end up inside the match.</description>

      <title>On the problems of software versioning</title>
      <link>https://benp44.github.io/blog/posts/nightmare-of-versioning/</link>

      <description>A metaphor&amp;hellip; Software versioning has always seemed to me to be one of the thorniest issues of software engineering. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain why using a metaphor.
Think of a large software project you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with. Now think about some of the details of that software; e.g. the different classes, modules, etc; some of the simpler and more complicated parts of the code; some of the known issues and bugs; any concurrency that might be involved; and of course some of those dark places in the code that are best left untouched.</description>

      <title>Improving your life with pre-commit</title>

      <description>What is pre-commit and how can it help me? If you&amp;rsquo;re not aware of pre-commit, it&amp;rsquo;s one of a variety of tools that you can use to run a series of tests and checks on your code at the point of committing to git. From the pre-commit site:
 [pre-commit] is a multi-language package manager for pre-commit hooks. You specify a list of hooks you want and pre-commit manages the installation and execution of any hook written in any language before every commit</description>

      <description>Testing multiple calls to the same mock method Situation: You want to test that a method of your mocked dependency is called multiple times with different parameters. For example, in the following code snippets we are testing that a method setProperty is called twice from within the method being tested. As we typically want to check only one thing per test, we would have two tests which EXPECT_CALL these calls:</description>

      <title>The backlog refinery</title>

      <guid>https://benp44.github.io/blog/posts/the-backlog-refinery/</guid>
      <description>tldr   It can be helpful to separate a backlog into multiple sections, stratifying cards into different stages of refinement.
  Cards start as raw, un-edited ideas and bugs in the first section, and proceed up to ready-to-code technical tasks in the last, with intermediate stages.
  This makes it really easy to focus in sprint meetings on the goal at hand: moving cards from one section to the next by &amp;lsquo;refining&amp;rsquo; them.</description>

      <description>This post is a collection of python unit testing &amp;lsquo;gotchas&amp;rsquo;.
Mocking external packages import sys import unittest from unittest.mock import patch, Mock, call, mock_open from io import StringIO, TextIOWrapper mock_os = Mock() sys.modules[&amp;quot;os&amp;quot;] = mock_os from config_editor import ConfigEditor Now we have effectively mocked all actual file I/O in our tests
Mocking in-built methods and file I/O Super useful if you want to test a unit that uses the builtin open method.</description>

      <title>Unit testing in Python with dependency injection</title>

      <description>A foreword on this approach to unit testing in Python Python is a very flexible language, and while the creators of Python tried to follow the guiding principle &amp;ldquo;there should be one, and preferably only one, obvious way to do things&amp;rdquo;, this flexibility inevitably means that there are &amp;ndash; in fact &amp;ndash; lots of ways to do things, some good, some bad.
Unit testing in Python is no exception to this.</description>

      <description>A quick one today, but an important one.
When working at startups and in small development teams, something I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot is the dangerous idea that it is possible to write any kind of non-trivial software without having given it some serious thought first.
I suspect this often comes from the classic abuse of the term &amp;ldquo;agile&amp;rdquo; as an excuse to drop some of the less tangibly essential aspects of software development and &amp;ldquo;just smash out some code&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Using and meddling with fzf</title>
      <link>https://benp44.github.io/blog/posts/fzf/</link>

      <description>What is fzf? If you&amp;rsquo;re a linux terminal user and not familiar with fzf, I would highly recommend giving it a try. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go to great lengths to explain the functionality here, as that information is available on the tool&amp;rsquo;s github page. But in short, fzf a search tool used for listing and browsing files,directories, command histories and other things. While this might not sound revolutionary, the clean, efficient way in which fzf makes this happen can really speed up your use of the terminal.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been working at home with a loud infant in the next room. As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve needed to wear headphones to concentrate. This raises the issue of finding a good source of continuous, ambient, non-commercial and enjoyable music. On this front, I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of somafm, which meets exactly those criteria. Soma is ad-free on the basis that it&amp;rsquo;s funded by donations, so if you enjoy, I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll find time to donate yourself and keep this awesome service going.</description>

      <description>Coding style 101   Have a coding style and follow it. Consistency is really important for code readability. And this goes for whatever code you&amp;rsquo;re working on - code that can seem throwaway at first may end up being re-used in a production project.
Not sure where to start? Have a look at some coding styles that have been created for you. PEP8 is a good start for Python. Google&amp;rsquo;s C++ style is pretty agreeable.</description>

      <description>Unit testing in C++ I cut my teeth with TDD working in C# and taking advantage of the variety of really nice unit testing and mocking tools available within the cosy Microsoft playground. But in the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself working with C++ a lot more, and I really wanted to ensure that the unit testing experience was, as far as possible, as convenient and powerful.
Unit testing can be a little dry at times (what!</description>

      <description>My name is Ben and I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer. I currently live in Cambridge (UK), with my partner and son. I have survived 15 years (and counting) working in the tech industry, mostly as a developer but also on occasion as an architect or technologist.
The first thing I programmed was a version of &amp;ldquo;worm&amp;rdquo; in BASIC on a 386 DOS PC, at my best guess around 1994. I have a BEng and MSc in Computer Science and have written software for medical, legal, educational and cultural organisations.</description>

      <description>Obligatory xkcd on the difficulties working with archives in Linux:
For most cases, the following function can be plonked into your .bashrc or .zshrc etc. to make extracting files a little easier.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # Extract function # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ function extract() { if [ -f &amp;quot;$1&amp;quot; ] ; then case &amp;quot;$1&amp;quot; in *.tar.bz2) tar xvjf &amp;quot;$1&amp;quot; ;; *.tar.gz) tar xvzf &amp;quot;$1&amp;quot; ;; *.bz2) bunzip2 &amp;quot;$1&amp;quot; ;; *.rar) unrar x &amp;quot;$1&amp;quot; ;; *.</description>

      <title>Bad comments</title>
      <link>https://benp44.github.io/blog/posts/living-comments/</link>

      <description>Have you ever noticed that comments usually appear greyed out or pale in most IDE colour schemes? This includes the markdown for this very post. I suspect that this is because in our collective consciousness as coders, we don&amp;rsquo;t think very much of comments. Comments are equivalent to a footnote in a book &amp;ndash; an optional extra that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really need to be read. I mean, almost the first thing a compiler does is remove all the comments.</description>
