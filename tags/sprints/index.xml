      <description>Your browser does not support the video tag.   The TLDR My team has recently been experimenting with various WIP (work in progress) limits. Actually we brought in the idea maybe a year ago, but I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently had some time to write about it with some hindsight.
You can read on for quite a lot of (possibly uninteresting) detail, but the TLDR is that a WIP limit is a very valuable tool, which I would recommend any established Scrum team give a try.</description>
