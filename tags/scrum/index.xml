      <description>The TLDR; My team has recently been experimenting with various WIP (work in progress) limits. Actually we brought in the idea maybe a year ago, but I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently had some time to write about it with some hindsight.
You can read on for quite a lot of (possibly uninteresting) detail, but the TLDR is that a WIP limit is a very valuable tool, which I would recommend any established Scrum team give a try.</description>

      <title>The Backlog Refinery</title>

      <description>tldr  It can be helpful to separate a backlog into multiple sections, stratifying cards into different stages of refinement.
 Cards start as raw, un-edited ideas and bugs in the first section, and proceed up to ready-to-code technical tasks in the last, with intermediate stages.
 This makes it really easy to focus in sprint meetings on the goal at hand: moving cards from one section to the next by &amp;lsquo;refining&amp;rsquo; them.</description>
