      <description>Testing multiple calls to the same mock method Situation: You want to test that a method of your mocked dependency is called multiple times with different parameters. For example, in the following code snippets we are testing that a method setProperty is called twice from within the method being tested. As we typically want to check only one thing per test, we would have two tests which EXPECT_CALL these calls:</description>

      <description>This post is a collection of python unit testing &amp;lsquo;gotchas&amp;rsquo;.
Mocking external packages import sys import unittest from unittest.mock import patch, Mock, call, mock_open from io import StringIO, TextIOWrapper mock_os = Mock() sys.modules[&amp;quot;os&amp;quot;] = mock_os from config_editor import ConfigEditor Now we have effectively mocked all actual file I/O in our tests
Mocking in-built methods and file I/O Super useful if you want to test a unit that uses the builtin open method.</description>

      <description>Unit testing in C++ I cut my teeth with TDD working in C# and taking advantage of the variety of really nice unit testing and mocking tools available within the cosy Microsoft playground. But in the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself working with C++ a lot more, and I really wanted to ensure that the unit testing experience was, as far as possible, as convenient and powerful.
Unit testing can be a little dry at times (what!</description>
